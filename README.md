# NLU-p2

train_RNN.py contains some sample code that trains the network (it's the same network as in project 1).

Supposed to become an implementation of http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-0907, and then be extended.

To come:
full_model.py is for models that supervisedly learn to predict which is the true story ending, from possibly rnn features as well as static features. train.py is for training these models.
